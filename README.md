# üö™ Automatic Door Control System
An IoT-based system that allows for **manual and automatic door control** to enhance security and track traffic. Developed with Arduino and Raspberry Pi using Flask, MySQL, and web technologies.

---

## üîß Features

### ‚úÖ Automatic and Manual Operation Modes

* **Auto Mode**

  * Opens the door during the day when a person is detected
  * Keeps the door closed and triggers an alarm at night if someone is detected
* **Manual Mode**

  * Allows store owners to override the system and directly control door and alarm states

---

### üëÅ Sensor Integration

* **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Detects proximity and motion (digital input)
* **Photoresistor (LDR):** Detects ambient light levels to distinguish between day and night (analog input)

---

### ‚öô Actuator Control

* **Servo Motor (SG90):** Opens or closes the door based on logic conditions
* **LED Alarm Indicator:** Lights up during night intrusions (in either manual or automatic mode)

---

### üß† Edge Computing with Raspberry Pi

* Processes sensor data
* Logs data to a **MySQL** database
* Hosts a **Flask** web server with real-time dashboard access

---

### üåê Web-Based Dashboard

Built with **Flask (Python)** + **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
Features:

* Real-time log display (distance, light level, door state, alarm state, control mode)
* Control toggles for:

  * Manual/Auto mode
  * Door state
  * Alarm state
* Customer traffic counter based on door open events
* Responsive UI for remote monitoring and control

---

### üíæ Data Logging

* All sensor readings and actuator states are stored in a **MySQL** database with timestamps
* Supports traffic analysis and performance tracking

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Upload Arduino Code**
   Open the Arduino IDE and upload the sketch at:
   `/edge_device_controller/edge_device_controller.ino`

2. **Identify the Arduino Serial Port**

   * Plug your Arduino into the Raspberry Pi or computer
   * Use Arduino IDE or run `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux) to find the connected port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`)

3. **Edit Serial Port in Python Script**
   In `edge_server.py`, locate the line:

   ```python
   ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0', 9600, timeout=1)
   ```

   Replace `'/dev/ttyACM0'` with your actual port from Step 2

4. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Edge Server**
   In the project directory, execute:

   ```bash
   python edge_server.py
   ```

6. **Open the Web Interface**

   * Visit the local address shown in your terminal
   * Use the interface to:

     * Monitor sensor readings and actuator states
     * Toggle control modes
     * Open/close the door or toggle the alarm
     * Count traffic within a given time range
